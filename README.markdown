XML. Why XML?
=============

TL;DR
=====
Send your goodreads endpoint in the "url" parameter of a get request, server will parse the xml and send you the json response.  


goodreads API as JSON
==========================

Inspired by [jayniz/jsonclips](https://github.com/jayniz/jsonclips).

I needed to access goodreads api from client side, but xml and same origin policy said no, no no.  
Luckily I knew a [guy](https://github.com/jayniz)  who solved a very similar problem for me back at [2012 Movie Hack Day](http://moviehackday.com)  

So I took it and [threw it on the ground](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAYL5H46QnQ).
